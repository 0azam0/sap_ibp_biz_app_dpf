# This is a registry of literal parameters that can be used as node inputs and/or node outputs.
#
# When defining node inputs in the pipeline, you can reference keys from this yaml to indicate
# that the pipeline should map the literal defined here to the node's input at runtime.
#
# Kedro precedent defines that the keys in this yaml can be referenced as below when defining
# node inputs:
# e.g. "params:my_key_1", "params:my_key_2.my_sub_key_2"

    headline_prompt: |
      You are a data analyst and your job is to explain to non-technical executive business leaders what the data suggests.
      Executive leadership will provide a sales forecast and you will interpret it and summarize the outlook, highlighting key insights.                         
      Your response should be only 1 sentence long, not very wordy. It should be like a news headline. Do not put quotation marks around it.
      Your response, while insightful, should speak to the general direction of the forecast.
      Even if you're unsure, speak with confidence and certainty.
