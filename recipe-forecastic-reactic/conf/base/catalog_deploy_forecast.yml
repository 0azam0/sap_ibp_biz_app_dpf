# This is a registry of files that can be used as node inputs or for storing node outputs.
#
# When defining node inputs in the pipeline, reference a key from this yaml to indicate
# that the pipeline should map the file defined here to the node's input at runtime.
# Similarly, node outputs can be mapped and persisted to files defined in this yaml.
